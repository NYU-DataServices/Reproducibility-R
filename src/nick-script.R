# Figure 5: A Comparison of Strength of Irish Monoglottism among Children Aged 1-9 to National School Enrollment Strength, by County, 1851

# Note: The following derived variables are used in this scatterplot, based on the following county-wide totals
# Total number of schools in 1851 was 4704; total number of students enrolled Sept 1851 was 517497; for march 1851 491395. Average for 1851 was thus 504446
# Total number of children aged 1-9, according to the L.A. Clarkson et al. dataset, was 1312156
# Total number of monoglot Irish-speakers aged 1-9 according to the L.A. Clarkson, et al. dataset, was 56124

# Creating a few new variables, showing 
# 1) percentage that each county had of the population aged 1-9 (per_schoolpop_1851)
# 2) percentage of the overall enrolled children each county had as calculated by using average of march/sept enrollment divided by 504446 (perc_scholars_1851)
# 3) percentage of total monoglot Irish speakers aged 1-9 each county had (perc_allmonIrish1.9_1851). This becomes the y-axis of the scatterplot
# 4) The "score" of enrollment success, i.e. the different between the percent of Ireland's enrolled students resident in that county and the percent of the entire Irish population aged 1-9 resident in that county (diff_percSchoolPop_scholars)
